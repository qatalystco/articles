Frappe CRM is crafted for providing a great user experience, packed with features for core CRM activities helping you build strong customer relationships while keeping things clean and organised.

### Motivation

  

The motivation behind building Frappe CRM stems from the need for a simple, customizable, and open-source solution tailored to modern business needs. Many existing CRMs are either too complex, overly generic, or locked behind steep pricing models that hinder accessibility and flexibility. Frappe CRM was designed to bridge this gap, offering a tool that empowers businesses to manage their customer relationships seamlessly while being easy to adapt to specific workflows. Built on the Frappe framework, it prioritizes usability, extensibility, and affordability, making it an ideal choice for growing teams and organizations looking for a CRM that aligns with their unique processes.
