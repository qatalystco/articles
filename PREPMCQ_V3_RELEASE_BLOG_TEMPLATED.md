# 🎉 Introducing PrepMCQ v3.0: Your Smartest Study Companion Yet

*October 15, 2025*

We're thrilled to announce the launch of **PrepMCQ v3.0** – our most comprehensive update yet! After months of development and incorporating feedback from hundreds of medical students, we've reimagined your exam preparation experience from the ground up.

## 🚀 What's New in v3.0

### 📊 **Completely Redesigned Dashboard**

Your dashboard is now smarter, cleaner, and more actionable than ever before.

#### **At-a-Glance Performance Metrics**
- **Predicted Score Card**: See your forecasted exam score based on AI-powered analysis of your performance trends
- **Real-time Progress Tracking**: Track exactly how many mock exams you've completed (7/10, 20/20, etc.)
- **Smart Goal Setting**: Visual daily goal tracker with 7-day activity trends
- **Study Streak Counter**: Build momentum with streak tracking 🔥

#### **AI-Powered Recommendations**
The new **"Focus On These First"** section uses machine learning to identify your weakest subjects and prioritizes them for you. No more guessing what to study next!

**Example**: If you're scoring 45% in Cardiology, 52% in Pharmacology, and 58% in Pediatrics, the dashboard will automatically recommend you start with Cardiology.

#### **Enhanced Activity Feed**
- Clickable recent activity cards with hover effects
- One-click access to your past quiz results
- Visual indicators showing your score trends

#### **Personalized Greeting**
Your dashboard now greets you by name and shows your exam countdown (if you've set an exam date) – creating urgency and motivation.

### 📚 **Knowledge Base: High-Yield Notes at Your Fingertips**

The most requested feature is finally here! Introducing the **PrepMCQ Knowledge Base** – a comprehensive library of high-yield medical notes designed for quick revision.

#### **What's Inside?**
- **4 Core Subjects**: General Surgery, Internal Medicine & Subspecialties, Obstetrics & Gynecology, and Pediatrics
- **Pre-highlighted Content**: Key facts and must-remember points are already highlighted in yellow – no more highlighting PDFs yourself!
- **Organized by Topics**: Each subject is broken down into bite-sized topics for focused learning
- **Searchable**: Quickly find any topic across all subjects

#### **Smart Reading Features**
- **Progress Tracking**: The system remembers where you left off in each topic

- **Mobile Optimized**: Read your notes seamlessly on any device
- **Clean, Distraction-Free Interface**: Focus on learning, not navigating

#### **How to Access**
