With state-of-the-art healthcare facilities, tax-free income, multicultural work environment, and excellent career growth opportunities, becoming a General Practitioner in Dubai is a dream for thousands of doctors worldwide.

However, the path to practicing medicine in Dubai requires navigating the **Dubai Health Authority (DHA)** licensing process – a comprehensive evaluation system designed to ensure only qualified medical professionals serve Dubai's diverse population.

This guide provides a complete, step-by-step roadmap to help you achieve your goal of becoming a licensed GP in Dubai, from initial eligibility assessment to securing your first job.

## Overview: The Path to GP License in Dubai

Before diving into details, here's a high-level overview of the complete process:

**Phase 1:** Eligibility Assessment (1-2 weeks) **Phase 2:** Document Collection & Verification (4-8 weeks) **Phase 3:** Primary Source Verification (8-12 weeks) **Phase 4:** DHA Exam Preparation (3-6 months) **Phase 5:** Exam Registration & Completion (2-4 weeks) **Phase 6:** License Application & Issuance (2-4 weeks) **Phase 7:** Job Search & Employment (Variable)

**Total Timeline:** Approximately 6-12 months from start to licensed employment

**Total Investment:** $3,000-$5,000 (including all fees, exams, and attestations)

Let's break down each phase in detail.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I apply for DHA license without a job offer?**

No, you need employer sponsorship for the final license. However, you can complete eligibility verification and take the exam independently, which makes you much more employable.

**Q: How long is the DHA license valid?**

DHA licenses are typically valid for 1-2 years and must be renewed before expiry.

**Q: Can my family join me in Dubai?**

Yes, once you have your employment visa and meet minimum salary requirements (usually AED 4,000-10,000 depending on number of dependents), you can sponsor family members.

**Q: Is the DHA exam difficult?**

The difficulty is moderate to challenging. With proper preparation (3-6 months of focused study), most candidates pass on their first or second attempt. Using quality preparation resources like [PrepMCQ](/features) significantly improves success rates.

**Q: Can I practice in other emirates with a DHA license?**

No, each emirate has its own licensing authority. However, having DHA license and work experience makes it easier to obtain licenses in other emirates.

The process is similar but you'll need to apply for specialist licensing, which has additional requirements including specialty certification and more years of experience.

**Q: Do I need to visit Dubai before getting licensed?**

You need to visit Dubai to take the Prometric exam (unless you're taking it in an authorized international center, if available). All other steps can be completed from your home country.
