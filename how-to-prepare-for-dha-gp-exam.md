This phase is all about applying what you've learned:

**Subject-Wise Practice:** Complete at least 1000-1500 MCQs covering all subjects. Focus on understanding why wrong answers are incorrect, not just memorizing correct ones.

**Clinical Vignette Practice:** DHA questions are scenario-based. Practice interpreting clinical cases, lab results, and imaging findings.
