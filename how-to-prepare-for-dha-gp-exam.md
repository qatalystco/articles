## Step-by-Step DHA-GP Preparation Strategy

### Phase 1: Assessment and Planning (Weeks 1-2)

**1. Evaluate Your Current Knowledge**

Start by taking a diagnostic test on [PrepMCQ's dashboard](/dashboard) to identify your baseline performance. This helps you understand which subjects need more attention.

**2. Create a Realistic Study Timeline**

Most candidates need 3-6 months of dedicated preparation depending on their medical background. Create a personalized [study plan](/study-plan) that allocates time based on:

- Subject weightage in the exam
- Your comfort level with each topic
- Time available before your exam date

**3. Gather Quality Study Resources**

Essential resources include:

- Standard textbooks for each specialty
- DHA-specific MCQ banks
- Online question platforms like [PrepMCQ](/features) with DHA-focused content
- Clinical guidelines and protocols

### Phase 2: Subject-Wise Learning (Weeks 3-16)

**Focus on High-Yield Topics First**

Given that Internal Medicine constitutes nearly 30% of the exam, prioritize this subject early. Use the [subject exams feature](/subject-exams) to practice topic-wise questions.

**Active Learning Techniques**

- **Concept Mapping:** Create visual connections between related topics
- **Spaced Repetition:** Review topics at increasing intervals to enhance retention
- **Clinical Case Analysis:** Focus on understanding clinical scenarios rather than rote memorization
- **Question-Based Learning:** Learn concepts through practicing MCQs rather than passive reading

**Daily Study Routine**

A productive daily schedule might look like:

- **Morning (3 hours):** Study new topics from textbooks
- **Afternoon (2 hours):** Practice MCQs on topics you've studied
- **Evening (1 hour):** Review incorrect answers and weak areas
- **Night (30 mins):** Quick revision of high-yield facts from the [Knowledge Base](/knowledge-base)

**Track Your Progress**

Use [PrepMCQ's analytics dashboard](/analytics) to monitor your performance across subjects. Pay special attention to:

- Subject-wise accuracy percentages
- Time taken per question
- Commonly missed topics
- Improvement trends over time

### Phase 3: Practice and Revision (Weeks 17-20)

**Intensive Question Practice**

This phase is all about applying what you've learned:

**Subject-Wise Practice:** Complete at least 1000-1500 MCQs covering all subjects. Focus on understanding why wrong answers are incorrect, not just memorizing correct ones.

**Clinical Vignette Practice:** DHA questions are scenario-based. Practice interpreting clinical cases, lab results, and imaging findings.

**Timed Practice Sessions:** Start practicing under timed conditions to build speed and stamina.

**Mock Examinations**

Take full-length [mock exams](/mock-exams) under real exam conditions:

- **Weeks 17-18:** Take your first mock exam to identify remaining gaps
- **Week 19:** Second mock exam to measure improvement
- **Week 20:** Final mock exam for confidence building

Analyze each mock test thoroughly. Review every incorrect answer and understand the underlying concept.

### Phase 4: Final Revision (Weeks 21-24)

**High-Yield Revision**

Focus on the most frequently tested topics:

- Common medical emergencies
- Drug doses and adverse effects
- Diagnostic criteria for major diseases
- First-line investigations and treatments
- Contraindications for common procedures

**Rapid Recall Techniques**

- Create flashcards for quick facts, drug names, and mnemonics
- Review clinical algorithms and flowcharts
- Practice rapid case interpretation
- Revise normal lab values and vital signs

**Avoid New Topics**

The last two weeks before your exam should be purely revision. Don't start new topics that might create confusion.

## Time Management Tips for DHA-GP Exam

On exam day, you have 165 minutes for 150 questions – roughly 66 seconds per question.

**During the Exam:**

1. **Quick First Pass (30-40 minutes):** Answer all questions you're confident about
2. **Second Review (30-40 minutes):** Tackle questions you marked for review
3. **Final Check (10-20 minutes):** Review flagged questions and verify answers

**Question-Solving Strategy:**

- Read the question stem carefully before looking at options
- Identify key clinical clues (age, gender, symptoms, lab values)
- Eliminate obviously wrong answers first
- Choose the most appropriate answer, not necessarily the perfect one
- Don't overthink – your first instinct is often correct

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. **Incomplete Syllabus Coverage**

Many candidates focus only on their comfortable subjects and neglect others. Remember, you need 60% overall – weak subjects can significantly impact your score.

### 2. **Passive Reading Without Practice**

Reading textbooks without solving MCQs leads to poor retention. Active practice through question banks like [PrepMCQ](/register) is essential.

### 3. **Ignoring Mock Tests**

Mock exams help you identify gaps and build exam temperament. Candidates who skip mocks often struggle with time management on the actual exam.

### 4. **Last-Minute Cramming**

Starting preparation 2-3 weeks before the exam rarely works for DHA-GP. Plan for at least 3 months of systematic study.

### 5. **Not Reviewing Wrong Answers**

Simply solving questions isn't enough. Analyze every incorrect answer to understand the concept and avoid repeating mistakes.

### 6. **Neglecting Clinical Guidelines**

DHA questions often align with current clinical guidelines. Don't rely solely on outdated textbook knowledge.
