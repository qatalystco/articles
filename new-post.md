We're thrilled to announce the launch of **PrepMCQ v3.0** – our most comprehensive update yet! After months of development and incorporating feedback from hundreds of medical students, we've reimagined your exam preparation experience from the ground up.

## What's New in v3.0

### Completely Redesigned Dashboard

Your dashboard is now smarter, cleaner, and more actionable than ever before.

**At-a-Glance Performance Metrics**

Track your progress instantly with real-time statistics showing your overall accuracy, subject-wise performance, and study streaks. See exactly where you stand without digging through multiple screens.

**AI-Powered Recommendations**

The new "Focus On These First" section uses machine learning to identify your weakest subjects and prioritizes them for you. No more guessing what to study next!

_Example:_ If you're scoring 45% in Cardiology, 52% in Pharmacology, and 58% in Pediatrics, the dashboard will automatically recommend you start with Cardiology.

**Enhanced Activity Feed**

Stay motivated with a personalized activity stream showing your recent attempts, achievements, and milestones. Celebrate wins and identify patterns in your study behavior at a glance.

## Knowledge Base: High-Yield Notes at Your Fingertips

The most requested feature is finally here! Introducing the PrepMCQ Knowledge Base – a comprehensive library of high-yield medical notes designed for quick revision.

**What's Inside?**

Curated summaries covering essential medical concepts, mnemonics for complex topics, clinical pearls from experienced doctors, quick reference tables and flowcharts, and evidence-based study tips from top performers.

Bookmarking and highlighting for easy reference, searchable content across all specialties, downloadable PDF summaries for offline study, and integrated links to related practice questions.

**How to Access**

Click on "Knowledge Base" in your navigation menu or from the Quick Access section on your dashboard. Search by subject, condition, or keyword to find exactly what you need.

## Dark Mode Support

Late night study session? We've got you covered! PrepMCQ now supports full dark mode across the entire platform.

**Benefits of Dark Mode**

Reduces eye strain during extended study sessions, easier on battery life for laptop and tablet users, and creates a distraction-free study environment for better focus.

**How to Enable**

Toggle between light and dark mode using the theme switcher in your navigation bar. Your preference is automatically saved and synced across all your devices.

## Separated Mock & Subject Exams

Based on user feedback, we've separated Mock Exams and Subject Exams into dedicated pages for better organization.

**Mock Exams Page** (`/mock-exams`)

Full-length simulations that mimic the actual exam environment, comprehensive performance analytics with detailed breakdowns, and timed mode for exam-style practice.

**Subject Exams Page** (`/subject-exams`)

Focused practice on individual topics, instant feedback with detailed explanations, and customizable difficulty levels to match your skill progression.

Both pages are now accessible from the main navigation menu for quick access.

## Design Philosophy: Minimalism Meets Functionality

v3.0 embraces a clean, minimalist design that puts your data front and center without unnecessary clutter.

**Enhanced Analytics**

Your performance metrics are now more accurate and actionable. We've refined our algorithms to provide insights into your learning curve, identify knowledge gaps, track improvement over time, and predict your exam readiness score.
