Oman's healthcare sector has experienced remarkable growth over the past decade, creating unprecedented opportunities for international medical professionals. As the country continues to expand its healthcare infrastructure, the demand for qualified General Practitioners has never been higher.

The gateway to practicing medicine in Oman is the **OMSB (Oman Medical Specialty Board) licensing exam** – a comprehensive assessment that evaluates your clinical knowledge and competency to provide quality healthcare in Oman's diverse medical landscape.

This guide provides everything you need to know about the OMSB-GP exam, from eligibility requirements and exam structure to preparation strategies and career prospects in the Sultanate of Oman.

## What is OMSB and Why Does It Matter?

### Exam Specifications
